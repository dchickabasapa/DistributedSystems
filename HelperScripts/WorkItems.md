Bugs:

- Fix the messages inside Build Scripts. 
    - Currently "Build Successfull" message gets printed even when Compilation fails. The message needs to 
      be in sync with the compilation result.


Improvements:

- Improve InitializationComponent scripts to auto populate build.xml file. 
- Build a helper script to create a class file and simultaneously update build.xml file.
